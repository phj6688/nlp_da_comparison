23	 In contrast, platelet serotonin showed very low values, which correlated negatively with all the former, except free serotonin.
17	 These data are consistent with 230-kD BP antigen involvement in keratinocyte basal cell interaction with extracellular matrix and indicate that the cultured cell may provide a useful model for analysis of 230-kD BP antigen function.
14	 Sodium bicarbonate promptly decreased cocaine-induced QRS prolongation to nearly that measured at baseline but had no effect on the other electrocardiographic or hemodynamic variables.
18	 Teased fibre studies showed evidence both of axonal regeneration and remyelination.
12	 In previously parathyroidectomized rats, the bilateral ureteral ligation had no effects on amplitudes of SEP or serum PTH levels.
4	 Although her auditory evoked potentials were well maintained during the operation, they deteriorated gradually and progressively for the following 2 months.
17	 Of the various morphological features analyzed, perinuclear cytoplasmic clearing had the lowest specificity for predicting positive results on in situ hybridization.
1	 Using a logistic regression model, multiple organ failure occurred 10.3 times more frequently and depression of left ventricular ejection fraction (less than or equal to 45 percent) 4.8 times more frequently in endotoxemic patients.
13	 Transient acute episodes of maternal hypertension between 180/90 and 190/100 mm Hg, documented within minutes after application of each electroconvulsive treatment, might explain the abruptio placentae manifested by active uterine bleeding and uterine hyperstimulation.
4	 The results of this study indicate that the c-erbB-2 oncoprotein may play a role in the pathogenesis of extramammary Paget's disease.
21	 The incidence of herniated nucleus pulposus was correlated with the patients' presenting neurologic status and mechanism of injury.
7	 This finding could imply that precytotoxic cells that are activated by interferon exist in peripheral blood or that direct recruitment of a new cell population takes place.
6	 The significant correlation with the severity of the disease and with the decrease of splanchnic resistances indicates that these changes in the HV waveform occur in the presence of marked rearrangements of liver tissue and of hyperdynamic systemic circulation.
14	 We reviewed our experience with cardiac MR imaging of this disorder.
3	Transmission indices of Loa loa in the Chaillu Mountains, Congo.
21	 Renal function studies were not statistically different between the groups after 2 years.
21	 Computed tomographic (CT) findings were diagnostic in all six cases.
20	 Length of survival was analysed in relation to year of diagnosis, AIDS-indicative disease, age, risk behaviour, zidovudine therapy, and CD4 cell count and serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels at the time of diagnosis in a group of 231 consecutive adult Danish AIDS patients reported before 1 January 1988.
6	 One patient had an exacerbation of her pancreatitis one day after ESWL, which resolved rapidly with medical treatment.
10	 Most patients had had several years of delay before starting therapy for their epilepsy, yet they responded well--a finding that does not support the suggestion that the disorder becomes intractable if not treated early.
10	 In the population studied, there was no decline in Ki with age for any of these structures.
6	 Pretreatment with a monoclonal antibody [IB-4] directed against the common beta subunit of the CD11/CD18 adhesion glycoprotein complex significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced both the vasocongestion and the prevalence of leukocyte margination.
4	 Ultrastructural single- and double-immunogold labeling of transgenic mice B-cell tumors (n = 3) showed insulin and IAPP to be colocalized in beta granules.
11	 The 700 cases have been categorized and analyzed.
19	Management of primary hypothyroidism.
1	 For impotent patients with severe Peyronie disease for whom other medical or surgical treatment is neither desirable nor suitable, we recommend implantation of an inflatable penile prosthesis combined with a possible straightening procedure.
9	 This data corroborates impressions that tumors of the larynx and hypopharynx rarely metastasize to the submandibular triangle and that sparing this area during neck dissection for lesions of the larynx would seem justified.
3	 Treatment of such adverse reactions with dexamethasone is highly effective.
11	 The incidence of optic disk drusen in cases of pseudoxanthoma elasticum is 20 to 50 times greater than that in the healthy population.
5	 Painful crises in sickle cell anemia are associated with infarction and subsequent fibrosis of many different organs.
10	 Vibrissae stimulation failed to increase glucose utilization significantly in cortical areas remote from the infarct.
14	 Doxazosin, at a final mean daily dose of 3.4 mg, produced a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in blood pressure at all points of measurement during the study.
8	 carinii pneumonia recurred within 6 months of the initial episode or responders without relapse if they remained disease free during the follow-up period.
16	 Sixty-nine percent of survivors had subnormal (less than 10th percentile) weight at discharge.
17	 A lower percentage (38%) of patients with RA had proliferative responses to collagen type II in comparison to 17% of responders in healthy controls.
10	 Although it localized the tentorial subdural hemorrhage either at the incisura area or at the tentorial leaflet, ultrasonography failed to identify all patients with retrocerebellar or posterior interhemispheric subdural hemorrhage.
